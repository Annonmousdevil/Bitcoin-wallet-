Bitcoin wallet codes 

First, you will need to create a backend server that handles the Bitcoin transactions. You can use the BitcoinJS library to interact with the Bitcoin network. Here are the steps you can follow:

1. Install the BitcoinJS library by running `npm install bitcoinjs-lib` in your project directory.

2. Import the library and set up your network configuration:

```javascript
const bitcoin = require('bitcoinjs-lib');
const network = bitcoin.networks.bitcoin;
```

3. Generate a private key for your wallet:

```javascript
const privateKey = bitcoin.ECPair.makeRandom({ network }).toWIF();
```

Note: This is just an example of how to generate a private key. In practice, you should use a more secure method of generating keys.

4. Create an address from your private key:

```javascript
const keyPair = bitcoin.ECPair.fromWIF(privateKey, network);
const fromAddress = keyPair.getAddress();
```

5. Set up the recipient's address and amount to send:

```javascript
const toAddress = 'trust_wallet_address';
const amountToSend = 0.001; // BTC
```

6. Fetch unspent transaction outputs (UTXOs) associated with your address:

```javascript
bitcoin.blockchain.info.unspent(fromAddress, function(err, unspent) {
  if (err) return console.error(err);

  // Create transaction and sign inputs
});
```

Note: This example uses the blockchain.info API to fetch UTXOs, but there are other APIs available as well.

7. Create a new transaction using the UTXOs and recipient information:

```javascript
const txBuilder = new bitcoin.TransactionBuilder(network);
txBuilder.setVersion(1);

unspent.forEach(function(tx) {
  txBuilder.addInput(tx.tx_hash_big_endian, tx.tx_output_n);
});

txBuilder.addOutput(toAddress, amountToSend * 1e8);

unspent.forEach(function(tx, index) {
  txBuilder.sign(index, keyPair);
});

const tx = txBuilder.build();
```

Note: This example assumes that you have enough UTXOs to cover the amount you want to send. In practice, you may need to combine multiple UTXOs or split them into smaller amounts.

8. Broadcast the transaction to the Bitcoin network:

```javascript
bitcoin.pushtx.broadcast(tx.toHex(), function(err, response) {
  if (err) return console.error(err);

  console.log(response);
});
```

Note: This example uses the pushtx API from blockchain.info to broadcast the transaction. There are other APIs available as well.

These are just some basic steps to get started with creating a website that allows for real Bitcoin transfers. However, there are many other considerations and security measures that you should take into account when building such a system.
